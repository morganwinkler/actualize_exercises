            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in the beautiful state of Florida and lived there for the majority of my life. My fiance and I just recently moved to
                a small town in Georgia and I absolutely love it. We built a cottage on a piece of land (phew, what an experience that was!) and are enjoying the
                "small town life." Not to mention our two pups love being able to run around!

            <h3>Work History</h3>
            <p>
                The bulk of my work experience has been in the hospitality field. I spent 10+ years as a bartender
                and manager and learned so much during that time. I worked very briefly as a registered nurse, but the effects of COVID
                were still too present and I didn't enjoy the job, and life is too short to not love what you do, right? My next
                adventure was opening a CrossFit gym. This was such an amazing experience and I wouldn't trade it for anything. During that
                time I was also an assistant to the CEO of a start up who was developing a gaming app. I really enjoyed the meetings and
                found the "behind the scenes" of coding to be intriguing. I started studying the basics of coding, as I thought it would at a minimum
                make me more knowledgable in my current position, but found that I loved it! That's why I have decided to join Actualize and 
                fully commit to becoming a software developer.
