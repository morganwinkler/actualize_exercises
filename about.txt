My name is Morgan. I was in the hospitality field for 10+ years before I 
got the opportunity to work for a friend that was creating a poker app. I 
have been working with that start up for the past two years and I found that I was
really intrigued by the coding and behind the scenes of how the app was getting made, so 
I started tutorials like The Odin Project and Codecademy, but am ready to 
fully commit and learn to code!
