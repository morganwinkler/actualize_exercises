# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number converted into a string.
# For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes ["1", "2", "3"]

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
string_numbers = []
numbers.each do |number|
    string_numbers << number.to_s
end

pp string_numbers

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
