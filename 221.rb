# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Make an array of hashes to store the first name and last name for 3 different people.
#  Then print out the first person's info.

    {'first_name' => 'John', 'last_name' => 'Doe'},
    {'first_name' => 'Jane', 'last_name' => 'Smith'},
    {'first_name' => 'Chuck', 'last_name' => 'Norris'}

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I was not. I forgot that the keys had to be in paranthesis as well
# so I kept throwing an error code and eventually looked at the solution
