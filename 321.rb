# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Start with an array of strings and compute the total length of all the strings.
# For example, ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"] becomes 29.

array = ["volleyball", "basketball", "badminton"]

index = 0
sum = 0
while index < array.length
    sum += array[index].length
index = index + 1
end
puts sum



# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# I was able to do this one without looking at the solution. Tomorrow I am going to
# stay in the same section and try to challenge myself
