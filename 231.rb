# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Write an Account class with attributes for name and balance.

class Account
    def initialize(name, balance)
        @name = name
        @balance = balance
    end
end

checking_account = Account.new('Checking', 5000)

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
# I was able to do it from memory. For the next deliberate question I want to do
# classes still but a harder one
