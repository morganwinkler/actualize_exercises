# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
# Make an array of hashes to store the brand and model for 3 different laptops. 
# Then print out the second laptop's model.

laptops = [
  { "brand" => "Microsoft", "model" => "Surface" },
  { "brand" => "Apple", "model" => "MacBook Pro" },
  { "brand" => "Dell", "model" => "XPS 13" }
]
pp laptops[1]["model"]
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
